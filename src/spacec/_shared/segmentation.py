def create_multichannel_tiff(input_dir, output_dir, output_filename):
    """
    Create a multi-channel TIFF image by stacking individual TIFF files from a specified directory.

    This function searches for individual TIFF files in the provided input directory,
    sorts them alphabetically by filename, and reads each image file into memory.
    It then stacks these images along a new first dimension (representing channels)
    to create a multi-channel image. The resulting multi-channel TIFF image is saved
    to the specified output directory with the given output filename. Additionally, a
    text file containing the channel names (derived from the filenames) is created.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_dir : str
        Directory containing the input TIFF files.
    output_dir : str
        Directory where the output TIFF file and the channel names text file will be saved.
    output_filename : str
        Name of the output multi-channel TIFF file (for example, 'image.tif').

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        A sorted list of channel names derived from the filenames. If no TIFF files are found
        or an error occurs, an empty list is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    This function loads all input images into memory before stacking. For a large number of
    high-resolution images, this operation may be memory-intensive.

    Formats image data into a dictionary based on the specified input format.
    Automatically detects number_cycles and images_per_cycle from image shape if not provided for CODEX format.

    Memory Consideration:

    - 'Multichannel': Assumes 'image' (3D) is already loaded. Creates 2D slices.
    - 'Channels': Reads individual files using tifffile. Can be memory-intensive if many large files.

    Parameters:
        image (ndarray or str): Input image data (NumPy array for CODEX/Multichannel) or directory path (for Channels).
        channel_names (list, optional): List of channel names. Required for CODEX/Multichannel.
        number_cycles (int, optional): Number of cycles. If None for CODEX, inferred from image.shape[0].
